# Skye Wind
Decided to take matters into my own hands and make a theme that combines both Skye theme and the theme used in Tailwind demonstrations, along with some other additions!
All the colours that are used come from the [Tailwindcss default colour palette](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#default-color-palette).

## Credits
This theme is based on [Skye](https://github.com/JamieBradders/Skye-VSCode-Theme).
